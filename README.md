**SiView** is an open-source 3D GDS viewer and visualization tool with Cadence Virtuoso integration.  
It enables interactive 3D inspection of IC layouts for analog and mixed-signal design teams.

---

### ðŸš€ Features
- 3D rendering of IC layouts directly from GDSII files  
- Cadence Virtuoso plugin using SKILL scripting  
- Process definition files for layer-to-material mapping  
- Support for large geometries and multi-GDS assemblies  
- Compatible with Cadence 6.x and Linux environments  

---

### ðŸ§  Background
SiView is inspired by the *GDS3D* visualization tool originally developed by the  
**University of Twente, Integrated Circuit Design Group**, and extended to  
support modern analog and mixed-signal design needs.
